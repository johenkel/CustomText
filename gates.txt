&7Everyone can create unlimited working portcullis gates of any size, check out working demo's at &6/warp tutorials&7.
&e» &7To build, create a gate (wood, iron or nether brick fence), at least two wide and two high.
&e» &7Contain the portcullis with a wall.
&e» &7Power the portcullis by powering one of the blocks adjacent to it on either side with redstone.
&e» &7&lImportant: &7Make sure an elevated portcullis is still in contact with a powered adjacent block, otherwise it won’t be able to be sent back down!
