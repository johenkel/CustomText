&7Everyone can create unlimited working bridges of any size, check out working demo's at &6/warp tutorial&7.
&e» &7Build a bridge from slabs/half-blocks or double slabs at least two blocks wide and three blocks long.
&e» &7Make sure there is at least one block adjacent to the bridge on three sides, so that it can't move in that direction. 
&e» &7For the direction in which you want it to move, make sure there is a block to stop at the distance you want it to move to. 
&e» &7Power one of the blocks underneath the bridge with redstone. Please note: you are powering a block underneath the bridge, not the bridge itself! Note that for the purposes of this plugin, just running redstone wire underneath a block will power it.

&e» &7Power more than one block to make the bridge move faster, Two blocks doubles the speed & three blocks doubles it once more (so four times as fast as one block). 
&e» &7Make sure that when the bridge is fully extended it is still in contact with redstone power underneath. It can be the same blocks, or different ones.

&e» &7When the blocks receive redstone power, the bridge will move to the south or east (in other words, increasing x or z coordinates; depending on which direction is free), when they lose redstone power, it will move to the north or west (in other words, decreasing x or z coordinates).
