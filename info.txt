#gates
&2&nWorking Portcullis Gates&7
&7Everyone can create unlimited working portcullis gates of any size, check out working demo's at &9/warp gates&7.
&c- &7To build, create a gate (wood, iron or nether brick fence), at least two wide and two high.
&c- &7Contain the portcullis with a wall.
&c- &7Power the portcullis by powering one of the blocks adjacent to it on either side.
&c- &7Important: Make sure an elevated portcullis is still in contact with a powered adjacent block, otherwise it won’t be able to be sent back down! 
&d &nhttps://piratemc.com/guides/portcullis/&7
#bridges
&2&nBuild Working Bridges&7
&7Everyone can create unlimited working bridges of any size, check out working demo's at &9/warp gates&7.
&c- &7Build a bridge from slabs/half-blocks or double slabs at least two blocks wide and three blocks long.
&c- &7Make sure there is at least one block adjacent to the bridge on three sides, so that it can't move in that direction. 
&c- &7For the direction in which you want it to move, make sure there is a block to stop at the distance you want it to move to. 
&c- &7Power one of the blocks underneath the bridge with redstone. Please note: you are powering a block underneath the bridge, not the bridge itself! Note that for the purposes of this plugin, just running redstone wire underneath a block will power it. 
&c- &7Power more than one block to make the bridge move faster, Two blocks doubles the speed & three blocks doubles it once more (so four times as fast as one block). 
&c- &7Make sure that when the bridge is fully extended it is still in contact with redstone power underneath. It can be the same blocks, or different ones. 
&c- &7When the blocks receive redstone power, the bridge will move to the south or east (in other words, increasing x or z coordinates; depending on which direction is free), when they lose redstone power, it will move to the north or west (in other words, decreasing x or z coordinates). 
&c- &7For working examples visit &9/warp bridges&r And Visit out website for detailed information and video tutorial.
